# Dataset 1:
* Name: Solar on Multifamily Affordable Housing (SOMAH) Program Dataset (file name - SOMAH_working_data_set_2022-01-03.csv)
* Description: This dataset includes all incentive applications for the Solar on Multifamily Affordable Solar Homes (SOMAH) program. The Solar on Multifamily Affordable Solar Homes (SOMAH) program is overseen by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) and provides solar incentives to
qualifying affordable housing within the service territories of Pacific Gas & Electric Company (PG&E), Southern California Edison Company (SCE), San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E), Liberties Utilities Company (Liberty), and PacifiCorp. The dataset is updated weekly and includes data on the status of proposed projects and applications, as well as incentive amounts, solar PV system cost and size, income level of building tenants, and project location. I plan to use this data to determine where SOMAH projects have been installed or are being pursued, as well as the relative income level of the tenant populations/census tracts where projects have been installed or are being pursued. I intend to compare this data with data on which census tracts in the state have the highest energy cost burdens, in order to determine if SOMAH projects are addressing disparities not only in access to renewable energy, but in utility cost burdens.

# Dataset 2:
* Name: Low-Income Energy Affordability Data (LEAD) (file name - lead-tool-map-data.csv)
* Description: This dataset includes calculations of average energy burden (calculated as average energy cost as a percentage of average income) by census tract and county in the state of California. It is provided by the federal Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. I intend to compare this data with data on the location and income level of communities where SOMAH projects are being installed or pursued. From this comparison, I want to determine if SOMAH projects are being pursued/installed in areas with high energy cost burdens.
