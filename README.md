# My Objectives for the Class:
I am primarily in graduate school in order to gain more technical skills and experience that I can bring to my career in environmental justice. Specifically I would like to focus more on energy equity and community-owned renewable energy. I would like to learn GIS in order to apply these skills to energy planning and policy. 
# Project Ideas:
Analyzing the distribution of rooftop solar in California, mapping energy costs compared to income in California, mapping hours of sunlight in order to determine best areas for solar projects
